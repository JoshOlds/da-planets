Da-Planets
==========

This project is an exercise in multiple full-scale application principles.
Da-Planets demonstrates back-end Node.js server creation and route handle. The Node.js server is responsible for handling API calls, as well as front-end hosting. The Node.js server is built to allow for deployment to hosting services, such as Heroku.com.

Da-Planets also demonstrates Google Firebase connectivity and usage. Da-Plaent's Node.js server utilizes the JSData package to handle object relationship mapping and Firebase integration.

Feel free to visit the front end page of Da-Planets to play with the API and datastructure!
